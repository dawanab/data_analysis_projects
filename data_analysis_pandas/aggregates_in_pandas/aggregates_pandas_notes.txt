III. AGGREGATES IN PANDAS

ðŸŸª Introduction ------------------------------------------------------------->
    > An aggregate statistic is a way of creating a single number that 
    describes a group of numbers. 
        >>> Common aggregate statistics include mean, median, and standard 
        deviation 


ðŸŸª  Calculating Column Statistics -------------------------------------------->
    > Aggregate functions summarize many data points (i.e column of a DF) into 
    a smaller set of values. 

    > The general syntax for these types of calculations is: 
    df.column_name.command()

    > Some common commands are:
    COMMAND         DESCRIPTION
    mean            Average of all values in a column 
    std             Standard deviation 
    median          Median 
    max             Maximum value in a column 
    min             Minimum value in a column 
    count           Number of values in column 
    nunique         Number of unique values in column 
    unique          List of unique values in column 


ðŸŸª Calculating Aggregate Functions I ---------------------------------------->
    > When we have a large amount of data, we often want to calculate aggregate 
    statistivs over certain subsets of the data. 

    > The general syntax for these kinds of aggregates is:
    df.groupby("column_name).column_to_work_on.measurement()
        >>> column_name is the column that we want to group by
        >>> column_to_work_on is the column that we want to perform a measurement on 
        >>> measurement is the measurement function we want to apply 

    > After using groupby, we often will need to clean the resulting data. 
    We can do this by using the .reset_index()
